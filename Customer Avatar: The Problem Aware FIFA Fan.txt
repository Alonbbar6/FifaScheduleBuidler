Stage of Awareness: Problem Aware
This avatar represents a segment of the market that is acutely aware of a significant problem but is not yet aware that a specific solution, like a dedicated scheduling and navigation app, exists. They are actively feeling the pain and frustration associated with the problem but are still in the phase of grappling with the problem itself, rather than evaluating potential solutions.

C → Why Are They
•Main Personality Traits: Analytical, passionate, loyal, and a planner. Javi is the kind of person who creates a detailed spreadsheet for his vacation itineraries.

3.Preparation: He believes in being prepared and doing his homework, whether for a financial forecast or a trip abroad.
4.Fairness: He gets infuriated by injustice, whether it's a bad referee call or seeing people without tickets push past families who paid thousands of dollars.

D → Smart Market Questions
•What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling: Javi lies awake replaying news clips of the chaos at the Copa América final. He visualizes the scene: arriving at the stadium hours early, just as he planned, only to be met with a solid wall of people. He imagines the pushing, the shouting, the feeling of being stuck. He worries about his girlfriend's safety in a potential crowd crush. Most of all, he stares at the ceiling and pictures the stadium lights, hears the roar of the crowd for the opening kickoff, and imagines himself still stuck outside the gate, his expensive ticket rendered worthless by the pandemonium.
•What are they secretly afraid of in life: His biggest secret fear is missing out on the peak life experiences he has worked so hard to afford and plan for. It's not just about the money; it's about the memory. He is terrified of the idea that his most anticipated moments—like seeing his team score in a World Cup match—could be stolen from him by something as stupid and preventable as poor crowd management.
•What are they angry about, and who are they angry at: He is incandescently angry at the event organizers and FIFA. He sees them as a faceless, incompetent bureaucracy that gladly takes thousands of dollars from dedicated fans but fails to provide the most basic level of security and logistical competence. He's also angry at the people who show up without tickets and try to force their way in, seeing their selfishness as a direct violation of the fan community's unwritten rules.
•Top 3 frustrations they feel every day (related to this problem):
1.The constant, low-grade anxiety that his entire trip—the flights, the hotel, the tickets—could culminate in him missing the very event he came to see.
2.The feeling of powerlessness. He's a planner, but this is a problem he can't plan his way out of. No amount of personal preparation can stop a disorganized mob.
3.The endless searching online for answers, only to find more horror stories. He reads forums and social media, looking for advice, but only finds more accounts of fans who missed games, confirming his fears.
•Biggest secret desire in life: To be able to fully and completely immerse himself in the joy of the World Cup without a single worry about logistics. He wants to walk to the stadium with his girlfriend, feeling nothing but pure, unadulterated excitement, get to his seat smoothly, and soak in the atmosphere from an hour before kickoff until the final whistle.
•Built-in bias to how they make decisions: He is heavily biased towards data and evidence. He trusts official sources but is now learning to supplement them with anecdotal evidence from other fans. He is skeptical of overly simplistic solutions and wants to understand the 'why' behind any recommendation. He will look for reviews, testimonials, and proof before committing to anything.
•Common words or language unique to them: "Logistical nightmare," "crowd crush," "bottleneck," "entry points," "queue management," "It's a matter of principle," "We paid good money for this," "How is this even possible?"
•Top 3 complaints about existing solutions (or lack thereof):
1."The official FIFA website just gives you a generic map and a start time. It's useless for navigating the actual chaos on the ground."
2."Relying on Google Maps doesn't account for the sudden street closures or the massive, unpredictable crowds."
3."Asking for advice on fan forums is a mixed bag. You get a dozen different opinions, and you don't know who to trust. There's no single, reliable source of truth."
E → Going Deep
•Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions:
1.Anxiety: A pervasive sense of dread about the upcoming game day experience.
2.Frustration: A feeling of helplessness and anger at his inability to control the situation.
3.Resentment: A growing bitterness towards the organizers for their perceived incompetence and lack of care.
•Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem:
1.Relief: The immense weight of anxiety lifting from his shoulders, allowing him to finally feel the excitement he's supposed to feel.
2.Confidence: The feeling of being in control, of having an advantage and a clear plan that will work.
3.Joy: The pure, uninhibited happiness of being able to fully experience the event he has dreamed of, without the shadow of logistical worries.
•Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:
1."Hard work and preparation should pay off."
2."You get what you pay for (and he's not getting it)."
3."Technology should make life easier, not more complicated."
•Biggest Lifestyle Desire: To live a life full of memorable, peak experiences that he can share with the people he loves, free from unnecessary stress and chaos.
F → Purchasing Habits
•Top 3 Decision Triggers:
1.Overwhelming evidence of a problem: Reading multiple, credible accounts of fans missing games is what solidifies the problem in his mind.
2.Fear of a negative outcome: The fear of missing the game or his partner getting hurt is a powerful motivator.
3.A desire for control and certainty: He is desperate for anything that will give him a sense of control over the chaotic situation.
•Prior Purchases For This Pain: He hasn't made any purchases specifically for this pain because he doesn't know any solutions exist. His "purchases" have been the time and energy he has spent on fruitless research: countless hours spent on Reddit, fan forums, and watching YouTube videos trying to piece together a viable game-day strategy.
•Price Tolerance For Offer: For a solution that could guarantee he gets to his seat on time and stress-free, he would easily pay a small, almost trivial fee. Given that he has already spent thousands on tickets and travel, a price point of $1-$3 per schedule would be an instant, no-brainer purchase. It's an insignificant cost to protect a massive investment.
•Time Horizon Of Solution: He needs a solution now. His anxiety is peaking in the days leading up to the match. He is not looking for a long-term subscription service; he is looking for an immediate, on-demand solution for his specific upcoming games.
G → Primary Wants
•Wants to gain: Peace of mind, certainty, a clear and reliable plan.
•Wants to be: On time, relaxed, a good partner who ensures their shared experience is positive and safe.

H → Empathy Map
•Seeing: News reports of stadium chaos, videos on social media of fans climbing fences, crowded metro stations, long, disorganized queues, and the frustrated faces of other fans.
•Thinking: "Is this going to happen to me? How can I prevent this? What's the best route to take? What time do we really need to leave? Are the official guidelines even trustworthy? I can't believe I spent all this money for this stress."
•Hearing: Conflicting advice from other fans online, news anchors describing the "pandemonium," the sound of his own heart pounding as he imagines being late.
•Feeling: Anxious, frustrated, angry, resentful, and powerless. A knot of dread in his stomach that overshadows his excitement.
•Saying: "This is a logistical nightmare." "I've been looking online, and it's a mess." "I just want to get to our seats without any trouble." "What's your plan for game day?"
•Doing: Spending hours on his laptop researching entry points, reading fan forums, checking Google Maps repeatedly, and discussing contingency plans with his girlfriend. He is actively trying to solve the problem, but without the right tools, he is just spinning his wheels and increasing his own anxiety.
