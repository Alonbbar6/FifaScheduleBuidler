### MVVM Pattern
The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern:

- **Views**: SwiftUI views for user interface
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and data binding
- **Services**: Data access and API integration

### Key Components

#### Data Models
- `Team`: Team information, colors, stadium details
- `League`: League information and season data
- `Match`: Match details, scores, and events
- `Player`: Player information and statistics
- `Standing`: League table standings

#### Services
- `DataRepository`: Central data access layer
- `APIService`: API integration with mock data
- `CacheService`: Local data caching and persistence

#### ViewModels
- `TeamsViewModel`: Team management and favorites
- `LeaguesViewModel`: League standings and data
- `MatchesViewModel`: Match tracking and filtering
- `FavoritesViewModel`: Favorite teams and matches

## Technical Stack

- **Swift 6**: Latest Swift language features
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Combine**: Reactive programming for data flow
- **Swift Concurrency**: Async/await for asynchronous operations
- **UserDefaults**: Local data persistence
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
