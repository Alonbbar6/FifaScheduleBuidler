The Diary of Javi Martinez: A World Cup Journey
Entry One: Before Using the Product
June 10th, 2026 - 11:47 PM - Hotel Room, Miami
I can't sleep.
The ceiling fan above our bed makes this rhythmic clicking sound—click, click, click—and I've been staring at it for the past two hours, watching the blades cut through the darkness. Maria is curled up beside me, breathing softly, completely at peace. I envy her. I envy anyone who can just... turn off their brain.
Mine won't stop.
I keep seeing that video. The one from the Copa América final. That wall of humanity pressing against the gates, the metal barriers bending like they're made of paper. I watched a man—someone's father, probably—hoist his kid onto his shoulders just to keep the child's head above the crush of bodies. The kid's face. God, the kid's face. Pure terror.
And I paid for this. We paid for this.
$3,200 for two tickets. Another $2,800 for flights. The hotel, the meals, the jersey I bought Maria as a surprise. I did the math in my head three times tonight: $7,400. That's not counting the days off work, the careful budgeting, the months of anticipation.
Seven thousand, four hundred dollars to potentially stand outside a stadium and listen to the roar of a crowd I can't see.
My chest feels tight. Like someone's sitting on it.
I made another spreadsheet tonight. My fourth one. "Game Day Logistics - FINAL VERSION (Actually Final This Time)." I color-coded the metro lines. I calculated walking times from three different stations. I cross-referenced official FIFA entry recommendations with Reddit posts from people who were actually there, on the ground, at other matches.
The official guidance says arrive two hours early. But some guy on r/soccer—username "FootballFanatic1978," so who knows if he's even credible—said he arrived three hours early for the semifinal and still missed the first twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. An entire third of the first half, gone.
I've read forty-seven forum posts tonight. Forty-seven different opinions. Some say go early, some say the early crowds are the worst. Some say use the north entrance, others swear by the south. It's like asking for directions and having everyone point in different directions while your destination burns down.
Maria stirred about an hour ago, mumbled something about me needing to relax. Easy for her to say. She's not the one who planned this trip. She's not the one who promised her that this would be perfect, that I had it all figured out.
I'm supposed to be good at this. Planning is literally what I do. I forecast financial models for a living. I predict market trends. I create contingency plans for contingency plans. But this? This is chaos dressed up as an event. This is a $7,400 gamble that I can't hedge.
The worst part—the part that makes my stomach twist—is the unfairness of it all.
We did everything right. We entered the ticket lottery the day it opened. We booked our flights six months in advance. We researched, we prepared, we invested. And yet, we might get the exact same outcome as some drunk idiot who shows up without a ticket and decides to rush the gates because "YOLO" or whatever justifies that kind of selfishness.
Where's the justice in that?
I can hear sirens outside. Miami never sleeps. Neither do I, apparently.
There's this knot in my stomach that's been there for three days now. It tightens every time I think about tomorrow. The match is at 8 PM. Kickoff at 8 PM. The moment I've been dreaming about since we won the lottery. Messi, on the pitch, probably his last World Cup. The anthem. The roar. The electricity.
And I might miss it because some bureaucrat at FIFA couldn't organize a proper entry system.
I keep playing it out in my head: We leave at 3 PM, just to be safe. We get to the metro station. It's packed. Shoulder to shoulder, the air thick and hot, smelling like sweat and beer and anxiety. We finally squeeze onto a train. It stops between stations—mechanical issue, they say over the crackling speaker. We lose thirty minutes.
We get to the stadium at 5:30 PM. Two and a half hours early. Should be plenty of time, right?
Wrong.
There's a sea of people. Not a line. Not a queue. A sea. No organization. No clear entry points. Just thousands of bodies pressing toward a handful of gates that open and close seemingly at random. Someone pushes Maria. She stumbles. I grab her arm, pull her close, but the crowd has its own momentum now. We're not walking anymore; we're being carried. A wave of human desperation.
I can see the stadium lights. Bright. Beautiful. Mocking.
7:45 PM. Fifteen minutes to kickoff. We're still outside. I can hear the crowd inside—a muffled roar that makes my heart race and my eyes burn. The anthem starts. I know it by heart. I've sung it a hundred times in my living room, in the car, in the shower. But now I'm hearing it through concrete and steel, distorted and distant.
8:00 PM. Kickoff.
We're still outside.
Maria's crying. Not loud, just silent tears running down her face, and I can't look at her because if I do, I'll lose it too. This was supposed to be our moment. Our story. The trip we'd tell our kids about someday.
Instead, it's a failure. My failure.
I blink and I'm back in the hotel room. The ceiling fan is still clicking. My heart is still racing. None of that has happened yet. It's just in my head.
But it could happen. It has happened to hundreds of other people. Why would we be any different?
I want to wake Maria up. I want to ask her if we should just skip it. Sell the tickets online, take the loss, spend the day at the beach instead. At least that way, we'd avoid the disappointment. You can't fail if you don't try, right?
But I can't do that. I can't rob her of this experience because I'm scared. Because I'm angry. Because I feel powerless.
So instead, I'll lie here. Staring at the ceiling. Listening to the click, click, click. Watching the hours tick down to a moment that should be pure joy but feels like impending disaster.
Tomorrow, we'll go. We'll try. We'll hope.
And I'll spend every single second until we're in our seats feeling like I'm about to throw up.
Entry Two: During Their First Use of Product
June 11th, 2026 - 4:32 PM - Metro Station, En Route to Stadium
I'm writing this on my phone. Thumbs shaking a little, but I need to get this down while it's fresh.
Something just happened. Something small. Something that might be nothing.
But it feels like something.
We left the hotel at 3:15 PM—fifteen minutes later than I planned because Maria wanted to touch up her makeup and I didn't have the heart to rush her. The knot in my stomach was already there, coiled tight, whispering that those fifteen minutes would be the difference between making it and missing it.
The metro station was exactly as I'd imagined: packed, hot, chaotic. Bodies everywhere. The smell of street food mixing with cologne and nervous sweat. A guy in a Brazil jersey was yelling something in Portuguese, pumping his fist. A family with three kids was trying to navigate a stroller through the crowd. It was sensory overload.
Maria grabbed my hand. Squeezed it. "We've got this," she said.
I wanted to believe her.
We were standing on the platform, waiting for the train, and I was doing that thing I do—running through the mental checklist, calculating arrival times, trying to account for every possible delay—when Maria's phone buzzed.
"What's that?" I asked.
She pulled it out, frowned at the screen. "Ad, I think? Something about World Cup schedules."
Normally, I'd have ignored it. I hate ads. I hate the algorithm thinking it knows what I need. But the timing was so weird, so specific, that I leaned over to look.
"FIFA World Cup Schedule Builder - Get to Your Game Worry-Free - $2.99"
My first thought: Scam.
My second thought: But what if it's not?
"Let me see that," I said, taking her phone.
The description was simple. Almost too simple. "Custom schedule for your specific game. Optimized routes. Real-time crowd updates. Entry point recommendations. Get to your seat on time, guaranteed."
Guaranteed. What a word. What a promise.
I clicked through to the app page. Reviews were recent—like, past few weeks recent. Four and a half stars. People talking about the Copa América, about other World Cup matches. One review said: "Used this for the Argentina match. Followed the schedule exactly. Got to my seat 45 minutes before kickoff with zero stress. Worth every penny."
Zero stress.
I tried to imagine what that would feel like.
"Should we?" Maria asked, reading over my shoulder.
"It's three dollars," I said. "If it's a scam, we're out the price of a coffee."
"And if it's not?"
I didn't answer. I just downloaded it.
The interface was clean. No clutter. Just a simple form: Which game are you attending? I selected ours. Where are you coming from? I entered our hotel address. What time is kickoff? 8:00 PM.
Then it asked: How do you want to feel when you arrive?
That question stopped me cold.
There were three options: "Relaxed - Arrive early, enjoy the atmosphere," "Balanced - Arrive with time to spare," and "Efficient - Arrive just in time."
How did I want to feel?
Not like this. Not like my insides were being wrung out like a wet towel.
I selected "Relaxed."
The app thought for a moment—just a spinning circle on the screen—and then it populated a full schedule. Not just a route. A schedule.
3:45 PM - Leave hotel (you're 30 minutes behind, but don't worry, we've adjusted).
It knew. It knew we were late.
4:10 PM - Board metro at [specific station]. Take Line 2 toward Stadium District. Avoid Line 1—currently overcrowded.
Real-time updates. It was pulling live data.
5:15 PM - Exit at Stadium North Station (not the main station—trust us).
5:25 PM - Walk to North Entry Gate C (less crowded, faster processing).
5:45 PM - Enter stadium. Grab food/drinks.
6:30 PM - Head to your seats in Section 118.
7:00 PM - Settle in. Breathe. Enjoy.
I stared at the screen. My brain, trained to find flaws, to poke holes, was scanning every line, looking for the catch.
But there wasn't one. It was just... a plan. A clear, confident, step-by-step plan.
"Javi?" Maria's voice pulled me back. "You okay?"
"Yeah," I said, though my voice sounded strange. "Yeah, I think... I think this might actually work."
"You trust it?"
Did I?
I looked around the platform. At the chaos. At the uncertainty. At the hundred different ways this day could go wrong.
Then I looked back at the screen. At the calm, clear instructions.
"I don't know," I said honestly. "But I trust it more than I trust my four spreadsheets."
Maria laughed. Actually laughed. The sound cut through the noise of the station, and for the first time in three days, I felt my shoulders drop half an inch.
The train pulled up. We got on. It was crowded, but not unbearable. I kept the app open, watching as it updated in real-time.
On schedule. Next stop in 4 minutes.
The knot in my stomach was still there. But it had loosened. Just a little.
I don't know if this app is going to work. I don't know if we'll get to our seats on time. I don't know if this is the solution or just another false hope.
But for the first time since we landed in Miami, I feel like someone—something—is on my side.
Like I'm not fighting this alone.
The train is slowing down. Our stop is next. The app just buzzed: Exit here. Turn left. Follow the signs to North Station.
Maria's squeezing my hand again. But this time, it doesn't feel like fear.
It feels like anticipation.
Okay. Let's do this.
Entry Three: After Using The Product
June 12th, 2026 - 1:23 AM - Hotel Room, Miami
I'm sitting on the balcony. The city is finally quiet. Maria's asleep inside, still wearing my jersey because she didn't want to take it off. There's a beer in my hand—local IPA, pretty good—and I'm watching the lights of Miami shimmer against the ocean.
I can't stop smiling.
I need to write this down. All of it. Because in twenty years, when my memory has smoothed out the edges and made this trip feel like a dream, I want to remember exactly how this felt.
We made it.
Not just made it—we glided in.
That app. That stupid, beautiful, three-dollar app.
We followed it exactly. Every instruction. Every turn. And it was like having a local guide who knew every secret, every shortcut, every trick.
When we got off at Stadium North Station instead of the main one, I was skeptical. The main station was where everyone was going. I could see the flood of people pouring toward it, a river of jerseys and flags. But the app said North, so we went North.
There were maybe thirty people at our station. Thirty. Compared to the thousands at the main hub.
We walked the route the app gave us—a side street that curved around the stadium, past a little food truck selling empanadas (we grabbed two, and they were incredible). The app buzzed: You're making great time. Entry Gate C is 200 meters ahead.
Gate C was... empty. Not completely, but compared to the main gates? It was a ghost town.
There was a security guy there, older, with kind eyes. He scanned our tickets, waved us through. "Smart choice, this gate," he said with a wink. "Most people don't know about it."
We were inside by 5:50 PM.
5:50 PM.
Two hours and ten minutes before kickoff.
I stood there, just inside the concourse, and I felt it: that knot in my stomach, the one that had been my constant companion for days, just... dissolved.
Gone.
Maria looked at me. "Javi, you're crying."
I was. Not sobbing or anything dramatic. Just tears, running down my face, because the relief was so overwhelming I didn't know what else to do with it.
"I'm fine," I said, laughing and wiping my eyes. "I'm just... we're here. We're actually here."
She hugged me. Right there in the middle of the concourse, with people streaming past us, she wrapped her arms around me and held on tight.
"I knew you'd get us here," she whispered.
But I didn't. The app did.
We grabbed beers—overpriced, but who cares—and walked around the stadium. We took photos. We soaked in the atmosphere. We watched the stadium fill up, section by section, the energy building like a living thing.
At 7:00 PM, we went to our seats. Section 118, Row 12, Seats 7 and 8. Perfect view. Midfield, slightly elevated.
I sat down and I just... breathed.
For the first time in days, I wasn't planning. I wasn't calculating. I wasn't running through worst-case scenarios.
I was just there. Present. In the moment.
The anthem played. I sang every word, my arm around Maria, and my voice cracked on the high notes because I was so full of emotion I could barely get the words out.
The match started. And it was everything.
Messi scored in the 23rd minute. A trademark run, a quick cut, a shot that kissed the inside of the post and rippled the net. The stadium exploded. I exploded. Maria and I jumped and screamed and hugged strangers and lost our minds in the best possible way.
We won 3-1. It was dominant. It was beautiful. It was perfect.
But here's the thing: the match itself, as incredible as it was, wasn't even the best part.
The best part was the peace I felt before it started.
The best part was sitting in my seat at 7:00 PM, knowing I had an hour to just exist in that space, to let the anticipation build naturally, to not be robbed of a single second.
The best part was looking at Maria and seeing pure joy on her face, untainted by stress or fear or frustration.
The best part was realizing that I didn't fail. I didn't let her down. I didn't waste $7,400.
I gave us the experience we deserved.
And yeah, I had help. Three dollars' worth of help. But I was smart enough to take it.
On the metro ride back, Maria fell asleep on my shoulder. I kept the app open on my phone, just looking at it. The schedule was complete, every item checked off.
7:00 PM - Settle in. Breathe. Enjoy.
I did. I really did.
There's a part of me that's almost angry it was this simple. That the solution was right there, three dollars and a download away, and I spent days torturing myself instead.
But mostly, I'm just grateful.
Grateful that someone, somewhere, understood this problem. Understood the fear, the anxiety, the helplessness. And built something to fix it.
I'm sitting here on this balcony, beer in hand, and I'm thinking about all the other people who are probably lying awake right now, staring at their ceilings, running through their own spreadsheets, feeling that same knot in their stomachs.
I want to tell them: You don't have to do this alone. You don't have to white-knuckle your way through it.
There's a better way.
Three dollars. That's it. Three dollars to turn the worst part of this trip into the best part.
Maria just called out from the bedroom, asking if I'm coming to bed.
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
Tomorrow, we've got tickets to another match. And this time, I'm not worried. Not even a little bit.
I've got my app. I've got my plan. I've got my peace of mind.
And I've got the memory of tonight—the anthem, the goal, the joy, the relief—burned into my brain forever.
This is what it was supposed to feel like all along.
