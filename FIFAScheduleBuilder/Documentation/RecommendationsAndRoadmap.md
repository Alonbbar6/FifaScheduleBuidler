# FIFA Schedule Builder - Recommendations & Development Roadmap

## Current Status: 73% Complete MVP

Your app has excellent core functionality! Here's what you have and what I recommend adding:

---

## ✅ What You Have (Excellent!)

1. ✅ Complete schedule generation with traffic intelligence
2. ✅ Full parking reservation system (ParkMobile integration)
3. ✅ Complete food pre-ordering system
4. ✅ Real-time map tracking with GPS
5. ✅ All transportation modes (driving, transit, rideshare, walking)
6. ✅ Crowd intelligence and gate recommendations
7. ✅ Beautiful UI with smooth animations
8. ✅ Cross-platform (iOS/macOS) support

### Technical Excellence
- Clean MVVM architecture
- Service-oriented design
- Comprehensive mock data for testing
- Error handling infrastructure
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 🚨 CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Launch

### 1. Location Permissions (Required)
**Priority: URGENT**
**Time: 10 minutes**

**What's Missing:**
- Info.plist configuration for location tracking

**How to Fix:**
1. Open Xcode → Select target → Info tab
2. Add key: `Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description`
3. Value: `"We need your location to track your progress to the stadium and provide real-time updates on your schedule."`

**Files:** See `/Configuration/LocationPermissions.md`

---

### 2. Enable Real APIs (Currently in Mock Mode)
**Priority: HIGH**
**Time: 30 minutes**

**What's Missing:**
- All APIs are in mock mode! Need to enable real API calls

**How to Fix:**

```swift
// GoogleMapsConfig.swift
static var useMockMode: Bool = false // Change to false

// ParkMobileConfig.swift
static let useMockMode = false // Change to false

// FoodOrderingConfig.swift
static let useMockMode = false // Change to false
```

**Requirements:**
- Valid Google Maps API key ($200/month credit free tier)
- Valid ParkMobile API key (contact ParkMobile)
- Food ordering API (Appetize, Grubhub, or custom)

---

### 3. Implement Schedule Persistence
**Priority: HIGH**
**Time: 2-4 hours**

**What's Missing:**
- Schedules aren't saved - users lose data when closing app
- "My Schedules" tab is empty

**Recommended Solution: CoreData**

**Implementation Steps:**
